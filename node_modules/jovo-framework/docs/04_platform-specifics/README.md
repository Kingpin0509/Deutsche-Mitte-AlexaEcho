## Introduction to Platform Specific Features

To learn more about how to make most out of the platform-specific features, it's helpful to understand how the Jovo cross-platform architecture works.

The Jovo `app` object figures out which platform the user is conversing with, and then uses this information to either call the functions of the `alexaSkill` or `googleAction` object.

As Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant both have platform specific features, you can access them directly by calling the `alexaSkill` or `googleAction` objects. By using those classes, keep in mind that, in the end, there needs to be a function call where an emit happens for the platforms you're using. For example, in the `[tell](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/03_app-logic/03_output#tell)`, `[ask](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/03_app-logic/03_output#ask)`, `[endSession](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/03_app-logic/03_output#no-speech-output)`, and raw [JSON response calls](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/03_app-logic/03_output#raw-json-responses).
