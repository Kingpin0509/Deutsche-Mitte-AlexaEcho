## Introduction to the SpeechBuilder

With the `speechBuilder`, you can assemble a speech element by adding different types of input:

```javascript
let speech = app.speechBuilder()
                .addText('Welcome to this Pizza Skill.')
                .addBreak('300ms')
                .addAudio('https://www.jovo.tech/downloads/pizza.mp3');

app.tell(speech);
```

As you can see above, you can initialize a new speechBuilder object by using `app.speechBuilder()`. Factory-like methods allow you to add your output subsequently. You can see all the [features below](#features).

## Features

Here is whatâ€™s currently possible with speechBuilder:

Method | Description
:--- | :---
`addText(text)` | Add plain text for text-to-speech
`t(key)` | Access `[i18n](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/blob/master/docs/03_app-logic/03_output/i18n.md)` language resources for multilingual voice apps
`addAudio(url, alternativeText)` | Add link to audio file and alternative text for Google Assistant. For more information on using audio files, see [App Logic > Output > play](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/03_app-logic/03_output#play)</a>.
`addBreak(time)` | Add a break to the output. Make sure to add a unit, e.g. "300ms"
`addSentence(text)` | Add a text within a sentence tag
`addSayAsCardinal(text)` | Reads a number as cardinal
`addSayAsOrdinal(text)` | Reads a number as ordinal
`addSayAsCharacters(text)` | Reads all characters of a provided string

## Add Variety to Your Speech Output

You can also use speechBuilder to add variety to your speech output. Here are a few things that work:

* [Randomized Output](#randomized-output)
* [Conditions](#conditions)
* [Probabilities](#probabilities)

### Randomized Output

For any of the speechBuilder methods, you can add an array of elements. The voice app will then pick a random item:

```javascript
let speech = app.speechBuilder()
                 .addText(['Hey there!', 'Welcome back!', 'Hi!']);

app.tell(speech);
```

### Conditions

You can also add a condition as a parameter to any speechBuilder method. The output will only added if the condition is true.

```javascript
addText(text, condition)

// Example
let speech = app.speechBuilder()
                 .addText('Welcome new user!', app.user().isNewUser())
                 .addText('Welcome back!', !app.user().isNewUser());

app.tell(speech);
```

### Probabilities

Similar to conditions, you can also add probabilities to speechBuilder methods. For example, if you add `0.3`, the element will only be added 3 out of 10 times.

```javascript
addText(text, probability)

// Example
let speech = app.speechBuilder()
                 .addText('Welcome!')
                 .addText('What a beautiful day.', 0.3);

app.tell(speech);
```
