* [Google Assistant Specific Visual Output](#google-assistant-specific-visual-output)

## Cards

With both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, developers have the ability to display visual information through the respective companion app. These visual elements are sometimes called cards, or home cards.

You can find detailed documentation provided by the platforms here:

* Amazon Alexa: [Including a Card in Your Skill's Response](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/providing-home-cards-for-the-amazon-alexa-app), and [Best Practices for Skill Card Design](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/best-practices-for-skill-card-design)
* Google Assistant: [Surface Capabilities](https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant/surface-capabilities), and [Basic Card](https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant/responses#basic_card)


### SimpleCard

A `SimpleCard` contains a title and body content. You can use the method `showSimpleCard` to display it.

```javascript
let title = 'Card Title';
let content = 'Card Content';

app.showSimpleCard(title, content)
    .tell('Hello World!');
```

Result in Alexa app:

![Alexa SimpleCard](https://www.jovo.tech/img/docs/simplecard-alexa.jpg)

Result in the Actions on Google simulator:

![Google Action SimpleCard](https://www.jovo.tech/img/docs/simplecard-google-assistant.jpg)

### Image Card

An `ImageCard` (`StandardCard` in Alexa terms) contains an additional image for more visual information. It can be added with the method `showImageCard`:

```javascript
let title = 'Card Title';
let content = 'Card Content';
let imageUrl = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/jovocards/SampleImageCardSmall.png';

app.showImageCard(title, content, imageUrl)
    .tell('Hello World!');
```

Result in Alexa app:

![Alexa ImageCard](https://www.jovo.tech/img/docs/imagecard-alexa.jpg)

Result in the Actions on Google simulator:

![Google Action ImageCard](https://www.jovo.tech/img/docs/imagecard-google-assistant.jpg)

You can also pass an object as `imageUrl` to provide a `smallImageUrl`and `largeImageUrl` (for Alexa Skills):

```javascript
app.showImageCard('Card Title', ' Card Content', {
        smallImageUrl: 'https://via.placeholder.com/720x480',
        largeImageUrl: 'https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800',
    })
    .tell('Hello World!');
```

Image dimensions:
* Amazon Alexa: Small images (`720px x 480px`) and large images (`1200px x 800px`)
* Google Assistant: Height is fixed to `192dp` ([see here](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/rest/Shared.Types/AppResponse#basiccard))

Important: Image files must be accessible by the public and support CORS (cross-origin resource sharing). For example, if youâ€™re hosting the file with the wrong permissions on AWS S3, and try to access it, the response could look like this:

```json
<Error>
  <Code>AccessDenied</Code>
  <Message>Access Denied</Message>
  <RequestId>DDDE88511DSGS6S86</RequestId>
  <HostId>
    g0asd6dEdsd6X8sdSSD234P9sSsw60SDSDeSdwsdE+sV4b=
  </HostId>
</Error>
```
