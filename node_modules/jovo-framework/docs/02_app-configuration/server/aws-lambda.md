[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a serverless hosting solution by Amazon Web Services. Find the [official documentation here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).

## Lambda Configuration

Here is what the beginning of a Jovo project for Lambda looks like ([see the sample repository index_lambda.js](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-sample-voice-app-nodejs/blob/master/index_lambda.js)):

```javascript
const app = require('jovo-framework').Jovo;

// Other configurations go somewhere here

exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    app.handleRequest(req, res, handlers);
    app.execute();
};

// App Logic below
```

## Creating a Lambda Function

While for Alexa, the process of hosting a Skill on Lambda is straightforward, for a Google Action there are additional steps that need to be taken to create an API Gateway. To learn more about how to run your voice app on Lambda, please take a look at our step-by-step tutorials:

* [Run your Google Action on Lambda with an API Gateway](https://www.jovo.tech/blog/google-action-tutorial-nodejs/#aws-lambda)

## Things to Consider

The [FilePersistence](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/06_integrations/databases/#filepersistence) database integration does not work on AWS Lambda. It is encouraged to switch to [DynamoDB](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/tree/master/docs/06_integrations/databases/#dynamodb) before uploading to Lambda.

## Troubleshooting

If your `tell` or `ask` responses aren't firing inside callbacks or promises on Lambda, try to add the following to your `exports.handler`:

```javascript
context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop = false;
```
